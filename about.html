                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Born in 12 July 1992, the artist <strong>Fateme Samare Hedayatzade</strong> grew up in <strong>Kerman, Iran</strong>, where she also completed her master's degree in pure mathematics.</p>
                <p>In 2016, she then moved to <strong>Paris</strong> with her husband, where, influenced by Parisian art and culture, she began painting and experimenting with various media, including <em>oil paints, coloured pencils, and pastels</em>.</p>
                <p>In 2019, she pursued a master's degree in applied mathematics. In 2021, she moved to <strong>Vienna</strong>, continued her studies remotely, and enrolled in an online drawing course.</p>
                <p>Since 2024, she has been living in <strong>Gdańsk, Poland</strong>, continuing her artistic journey in a new cultural environment.</p>
                <p>Deeply inspired by the world of art, she dedicated herself entirely to painting, leaving her master's program to explore her artistic strengths beyond just materials and media.</p>
                <p>She further refined her skills through three online art courses and by working under the supervision of an artist, receiving valuable feedback and learning about <strong>art history</strong>.</p>
                <p>Being far from her country, family, and everything she loves deeply affects her artwork. Fateme often collects photos of her family and incorporates them into her paintings—it’s her way of keeping them close, as if wanting to have them within her life every day.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, when she paints, she feels it’s similar to photography—watching a picture slowly take shape on the paper. It’s at the moment just before the image fully appears that she stops painting, because that’s when the artwork captures the important feeling or moment she wants to preserve.</p>
